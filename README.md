#   Project 1: Papi's Pizzeria Sales Dashboard
This project I did as my first Power BI Project, where I created a sales dashboard for 2015 for a small pizza company (Papiâ€™s Pizzeria).

1.Data was gotten from Kaggle datasets.
2.The data was loaded into power query and transform by creating different a date table for date trends using DAX.
3.Used DAX to create a new column for revenue by combining two other columns.
4.Final transformed dataset was loaded for visualization.
